# krishna-chilukuri.github.io

This site is developed by me (Krishna Prudhvi Chilukuri) as a Portfolio webpage.
It is initially maintained under the Portfolio repository in my GitHub.
Then it is cloned to krishna-chilukuri.github.io

The main branch is the live version of the size currently hosted.
The master branch is the copy of the first stable hosted code of the site. This would be used if needed.
